# Pre90secs


### Overview
Pre90secs is an Android application built to support the Pre90secs company and exercise methodology.

With Pre90secs the goal is to instill mini-habits and mindfulness by requiring 90 seconds of exercise before any calories are consumed.

With this, the Pre90secs Android application includes these features:

  - Random generation of exercises with photos and instructions
  - 90 second timer with completion buzzer
  - Filers to select by difficult, body region emphasis, and if there is limited space

### Version
1.1.0

### Tech

Pre90secs uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [GSON] - used to convert a JSON string to an equivalent Java object
* [TotallyLazy] - brings functional programming techniques to Java


And of course Competition Practice Player itself is open source with a [public repository](https://github.com/alliejc/compeitionpracticeplayer)
 on GitHub.
